## A demo app to get you familiar with the bottom navigation bar in Flutter

The idea is the user will play one of rock/paper/scissor using one of the three buttons in the buttom navigator and at times of tapping, the app will generate a random response to play the game.

By playing aroung with this, you will know:
* Why the bottom navigation in Flutter is not a navigator (unlike React Native).
* How to handle tapping event on the bottom navigation bar.
* How to store the state of tapping.
* How to use the state of tapping.

## Contribute

If you happen to have some great ideas (good memes, good icons, better design, better learning material, etc) while playing around with it, send me a pull request! I will try my best to review and merge it ASAP.

## As always, happy coding!
